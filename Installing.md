# Overview #

Although many applications are available via the [Android Market](http://www.android.com/market/), there are often times where it can be preferable to install an application from another source. Due to the security measures put in place by Android, this cannot be done without changing the default settings on your phone.

## Instructions ##

The following steps should work on most devices, but the interface may not look precisely the same. The screenshots are from an EVO 4g phone, but feel free to add your device to the tutorial if it requires a different procedure. Due to carrier imposed restrictions, these steps will _not_ currently work on AT&T devices.

  * Go into the Settings menu.
  * Select "Applications" from the main menu.
  * Make sure the "Unknown sources" box is checked:
